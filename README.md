## ‚úèÔ∏è Description

The purpose of this project is to examine the relationship between Google's [Core Web Vitals metrics](https://web.dev/explore/learn-core-web-vitals) and energy consumption on a Google Pixel 6.

An in-depth description of this experiment can be found in the [research paper](https://www.overleaf.com/read/snmthytxnrst#1030cc) written for this assignment for the Green Lab module at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.

## üèóÔ∏è Structure

The code for this project is broken into 5 parts:

- [data](data): The data that was collected during the experiment. It contains the Tranco top 1000 websites and a Python script that sorts through the websites, pings them and creates a list of the top 50.
- [android-runner](batterymanager): A modified version of the [Android Runner](https://github.com/S2-group/android-runner/) system built by the S2 Group at Vrije Universitiet Amsterdam, which is used to run the experiment.
- [proxy](proxy): A [mitmproxy](https://mitmproxy.org/) script that is used to inject JavaScript into each website that loads Core Web Vital metrics, and sends data back to our receiver.
- [receiver](receiver): A Node JS server that receives the data from the proxy and stores it in a CSV file.
- [analysis](analysis): An R studio project that is used to analyse the data and generate graphs.

## ‚úÖ Prerequisites

### üì± Hardware

- [Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+ with 4GB of RAM](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b-plus/)
- [Google Pixel 6](https://store.google.com/nl/product/pixel_6a?hl=nl)

### üñ•Ô∏è Software

The following packages may need to be installed on the Raspberry Pi:

- [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [mitmproxy](https://mitmproxy.org/)
- [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/)
- [adb](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb)

## ü§î How to run

This experiment was designed to run on a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B with 4GB of RAM. The Raspberry Pi should be running the latest version of Raspberry Pi OS. To replicate the project, the following steps should be taken:

1. Clone this repository onto the Raspberry Pi
2. Clone the Android Runner in the parent directory of this repository `https://github.com/S2-group/android-runner.git`
3. Install the Android Runner dependencies <br/>
   `cd android-runner && pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
4. Install the python dependencies <br/>`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
5. Install the node dependencies in the receiver directory <br> `cd receiver && npm install`
6. Create 3 ssh sessions to the Raspberry Pi and run the following:
   1. `mitmproxy -s proxy.py`
   2. `node receiver/app.js`
   3. `ngrok http 3000`
7. The `ngrok` window will give you a https URL. Copy this URL into the `.env` file.
8. Finally you can run the experiment using the following command: <br>
   `sudo python3 android-runner android-runner/examples/batterymanager/config_web.json`

All outputs will be stored in the `android-runner/examples/batterymanager/output` directory.
