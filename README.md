# ü™¥ Green Lab Core Web Vitals Experiment

## ‚úèÔ∏è Description

The purpose of this project is to examine the relationship between Google's [Core Web Vitals metrics](https://web.dev/explore/learn-core-web-vitals) and energy consumption on an Google Pixel 6.

An indepth description of this experiment can be found on the [research paper](https://www.overleaf.com/read/snmthytxnrst#1030cc) written for this assignment for the Green Lab module at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.

## ‚úÖ Prerequisites

### üì± Hardware

- [Raspberry Pi 4 Model B with 4GB of RAM](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/)
- [Google Pixel 6](https://store.google.com/nl/product/pixel_6a?hl=nl)

### üñ•Ô∏è Software

The following packages may need to be installed on the Raspberry Pi:

- [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [mitmproxy](https://mitmproxy.org/)
- [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/)

## ü§î How to run

This experiment was designed to run on a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B with 4GB of RAM. The Raspberry Pi should be running the latest version of Raspberry Pi OS. To replicate the project, the following steps should be taken:

1. Clone this repository onto the Raspberry Pi
2. Clone the Android Runner in the parent directory of this repository `https://github.com/S2-group/android-runner.git`
3. Install the Android Runner dependencies <br/>
   `cd android-runner && pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
4. Install the python dependencies <br/>`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
5. Install the node depedencies in the receiver directory <br> `cd receiver && npm install`
6. Create 3 ssh sessions to the Raspberry Pi and run the following:
   1. `mitmproxy -s proxy.py`
   2. `node receiver/app.js`
   3. `ngrok http 3000`
7. The `ngrok` window will give you a https url. Copy this URL into the `.env` file.
